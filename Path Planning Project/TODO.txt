TODO
====
- Write code to display a representation of each tile and object in the display window. DONE
- Write code to change the positions of the robots and update the display accordingly. 
  - Hasn't been implemented yet, but is nothing more than calling move(dx * SCALE_FACTOR, dy * SCALE_FACTOR) on every object in our world.
- Implement the freaking A* or A* based algorithm, otherwise we have no project in the first place.
- Gabe suggests including a button to solve the problem at either a constant speed or instantaneously.
       * If we go the constant speed route, Brad suggests adding the ability to press the button again to stop.
- Discover the meaning of life and find inner peace.
